# BeatSaberCampaignCreator
An application for creating custom campaigns to be used with the [Custom Campaigns](https://github.com/monkeymanboy/BeatSaberCustomCampaigns) plugin

## Getting Started
Simply click `File>New` and either pick or make an empty folder to create your campaign in to make things simple you can do this in your CustomCampaigns folder

After this mostly everything is explained in the editor

## Cover Image
Place an image called `cover.png` in the folder for your campaign size doesn't matter, just do what looks good and isn't too big

## Background Image
Place an image called `map background.png` in the folder for your campaign size doesn't matter, just do what looks good and fits the map size

The width will be stretched to fit the map area and the height will be adjusted to retain aspect ratio

## Unlockable Items
Create a folder inside your campaign folder called `unlockables` and just place what you want to get unlocked in here

When adding unlockables to maps ensure that you include the file extension

## Unlockable Songs
After checking unlockable song on a given challenge you need to have the map specifically set up for the song to be unlocked

Just add `Complete Campaign Challenge - challenge name` to the requirements field of the map, you can either do this for some or all difficulties just keep in mind the ones without this requirement will always be unlocked

## External Requirements
This feature will be updated so that mods can include info about modifiers so for now don't worry about it

If you are a modder that wants to add external requirement support let me know and I will update this feature much sooner
